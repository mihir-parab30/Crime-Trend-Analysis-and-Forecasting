# 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Trend Analysis and Forecasting Using Los Angeles Crime Data (2020–2024)

## 🔍 Abstract

This project investigates crime patterns in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024 using a dataset of over 900,000 crime records. The objective was to clean and structure the raw data, extract actionable insights, and forecast future trends. We applied statistical methods and time series forecasting (ARIMA) to identify crime hotspots, recurring offense types, and socioeconomic influences. The outcome supports policy planning, law enforcement decision-making, and public safety strategy through dashboards, KPIs, and executive-level summaries.
